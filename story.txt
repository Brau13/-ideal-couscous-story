It is wednesday October 2nd and I am sitting in my comp sci 400 class while it is raining outside. My umbrella broke because of the wind. Why can't Wisconsin have a longer summer? Would be nice.

I really should have made the most of such a short summer in Wisconsin but I was stuck with all college assignments. I recalled that when I was in elementary school summer seemed forever since I can play as much as I want. How time flies.

Now, yet again it rains and it's even colder! How I hate Wisconsin weather, I'm surprised I chose to go to a school in a place like this. But, I love the people and the city so there's that. I must prepare for the Wisconsin winter that is soon approaching...
